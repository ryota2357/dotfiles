# Coding Style

- Declare variables immediately before use; minimize scope
- Variable declarations should read as a summary of data flow
- No comments that explain what code does; only why (constraints, non-obvious business rules)
- Test code should clearly describe WHAT is being tested

# Language

- All documentation, comments, and commits in English
